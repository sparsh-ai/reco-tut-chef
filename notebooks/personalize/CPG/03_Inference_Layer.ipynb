    "Up to this point we have trained and deployed three Amazon Personalize campaigns based on historical data that we generated in this workshop. This allows us to make related product, user recommendations, and rerank product lists based on already observed behavior of our users. However, user intent often changes in real-time such that what products the user is interested in now may be different than what they were interested in a week ago, a day ago, or even a few minutes ago. Making recommendations that keep up with evolving user intent is one of the more difficult challenges with personalization. Fortunately, Amazon Personalize has a mechanism for this exact case.\n",
